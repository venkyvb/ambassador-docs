# `edgectl install`: Installer Failed to Create Host Resource

The installer was unable to create a new Host resource using `kubectl apply` with the Host manifest.

## What's next?

If this appears to be an intermittent failure, try running the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

It is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

Otherwise, please get in touch on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
