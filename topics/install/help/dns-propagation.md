# Edgectl Install: DNS Failed to Propagate to This Host

The installer has acquired a DNS name for your cluster but is unable to resolve that name on your host.

## What's next?

If this appears to be an intermittent failure, try running the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

It is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

Otherwise, please get in touch on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
