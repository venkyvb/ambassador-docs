# `edgectl install`: Couldn't access the EdgeStack.me service

The installer could not access the EdgeStack.me service to acquire a DNS name for your cluster's load balancer.

## What's next?

This is likely an intermittent failure of the service. Please try again later. Simply start the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

It is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

If this failure persists, please get in touch on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
