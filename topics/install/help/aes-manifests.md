# `edgectl install`: Can't reach the Internet

The installer retrieves information required to install AES over the Internet. If Internet connectivity is not available, the installer cannot proceed. 

## What's next?

1. Restore Internet connectivity. Perhaps there is a VPN or firewall preventing access to the Internet.
2. Start the installer again:
   ```shell
   edgectl install
   ```

It is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.
