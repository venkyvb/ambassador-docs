# Edgectl Install: Failed to Acquire TLS Certificate
 
The installer was unable to acquire a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt.

## What's next?

If this appears to be an intermittent failure, try running the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

Don't worry: it is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

Otherwise, please get in touch on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
