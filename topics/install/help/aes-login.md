# `edgectl install`: Failed to Log In to AES

In attempting to open a browser window on the Ambassador Edge Stack Policy Console, the installer was unable to connect to the service in your cluster.

## What's next?

If this appears to be an intermittent failure, try running the installer again:

```shell
edgectl install
```

It is safe to run the installer repeatedly on a cluster.

Otherwise, please get in touch on [Slack](http://d6e.co/slack).
