# edgectl install: Timed Out Waiting for the Load Balancer to Respond
 
The installer timed out while waiting for the load balancer to return its IP address for the AES Service. 

You might try running the installer again.

If your cluster doesn't support load balancers, you'll need to expose AES in some other way.
