# Core concepts

This section of the documentation introduces core concepts of Kubernetes and Ambassador. Kubernetes and microservices introduce a number of new, powerful paradigms for software development, and Ambassador takes full advantage of these paradigms.

This section discusses:

* [The Kubernetes Network Architecture and Ambassador](../kubernetes-network-architecture.md)
* [Microservices API Gateways](../microservices-api-gateways)
* [The Ambassador Operating Model: Continuous Delivery, GitOps, and Declarative Configuration](../gitops-continuous-delivery.md)
* [Progressive Delivery](../progressive-delivery.md)
