# How can I ship software faster - _safely_?

In the "you build it, you run it" style of cloud-native application development, the full life cycle of a service, including coding, testing, deployment, release and operations, becomes a part of the development team's workflow. Working with microservices on smaller, independent services enables autonomy and speed, but this adds complexity. Making these services work together without breaking anything adds risk to the deployment equation.

It's inevitable that you'll ship bugs, and things are going to break. How can you limit the scope and scale of the damage and keep things running?

This is where progressive delivery strategies, GitOps, Argo CD, Argo Rollouts and other advanced deployment capabilities enter the picture.
