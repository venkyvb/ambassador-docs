In this guide we'll give you **everything you need in a preconfigured demo cluster:** the Telepresence CLI, a config file for connecting to your demo cluster, and code to run a cluster service locally. 

<Alert severity="info">
    While Telepresence works with any language, this guide uses a sample app with a frontend written in React. We have a version with a <a href="../qs-node/">NodeJS backend</a> if you prefer.
</Alert>

<!--
<Alert severity="info">
    <strong>Already have a cluster?</strong> Switch over to a <a href="../qs-node">version of this guide</a> that takes you though the same steps using your own cluster.
</Alert>
-->

## 1. Download the demo cluster archive

1. <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/demo-cluster-download-popup" onClick={(e) => {window.open('https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/demo-cluster-download-popup', 'ambassador-cloud-demo-cluster', 'menubar=no,location=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=no,width=550,height=750'); e.preventDefault(); }} target="_blank">Sign in to Ambassador Cloud to download your demo cluster archive.</a>  The archive contains all the tools and configurations you need to complete this guide.

2.  Extract the archive file, open the `ambassador-demo-cluster` folder, and run the installer script (the commands below might vary based on where your browser saves downloaded files).

  <Alert severity="info">
    This step will also install some dependency packages onto your laptop using npm, you can see those packages at <code>ambassador-demo-cluster/edgey-corp-nodejs/DataProcessingService/package.json</code>.
  </Alert>

  ```
  cd ~/Downloads
  unzip ambassador-demo-cluster.zip -d ambassador-demo-cluster
  cd ambassador-demo-cluster
  ./install.sh
  [type y to install the npm dependencies when asked]
  ```
 
3. Confirm that your `kubectl` is configured to use the demo cluster by getting the status of the cluster nodes, you should see a single node named `tpdemo-prod-...`:    
  `kubectl get nodes`

  ```
   $ kubectl get nodes
    
    NAME               STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
    tpdemo-prod-1234   Ready    control-plane,master   5d10h   v1.20.2+k3s1
  ```

4. Confirm that the Telepresence CLI is now installed (we expect to see the daemons are not running yet):  
`telepresence status`

  ```
  $ telepresence status
    
    Root Daemon: Not running
    User Daemon: Not running
  ```

  <Alert severity="info">
    <strong>macOS users:</strong> If you receive an error when running Telepresence that the developer cannot be verified, open <strong>System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General</strong>. Click <strong>Open Anyway</strong> at the bottom to bypass the security block. Then retry the <code>telepresence status</code> command.
  </Alert>

<Alert severity="success">
    You now have Telepresence installed on your workstation and a Kubernetes cluster configured in your terminal!
</Alert>

## 2. Test Telepresence

Telepresence connects your local workstation to a remote Kubernetes cluster.

1. Connect to the cluster (this requires root privileges and will ask for your password):  
`telepresence connect`

  ```
  $ telepresence connect
    
    Launching Telepresence Daemon
    ...
    Connected to context default (https://<cluster-public-IP>)
  ```

2. Test that Telepresence is working properly by connecting to the Kubernetes API server:  
`curl -ik https://kubernetes.default`

  ```
  $ curl -ik https://kubernetes.default
    
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Cache-Control: no-cache, private
    Content-Type: application/json
    ...

  ```

  <Alert severity="info">
    The 401 response is expected.  What's important is that you were able to contact the API.
  </Alert>

<Alert severity="success">
    <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You‚Äôve just accessed your remote Kubernetes API server, as if you were on the same network! With Telepresence, you‚Äôre able to use any tool that you have locally to connect to any service in the cluster.
</Alert>

## 3. Set up the sample application

Your local workstation may not have the compute or memory resources necessary to run all the services in a multi-service application. In this example, we‚Äôll show you how Telepresence can give you a fast development loop, even in this situation.

<!--
We'll use a sample app that is already installed in your demo cluster.  Let's take a quick look at it's architecture before continuing.
-->

1. Clone the emojivoto app:  
`git clone https://github.com/datawire/emojivoto.git`

1. Deploy the app to your cluster:  
`kubectl apply -k emojivoto/kustomize/deployment`

1. Change the kubectl namespace:  
`kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=emojivoto`

1. List the Services:  
`kubectl get svc`

  ```
  $ kubectl get svc
    
    NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
    emoji-svc    ClusterIP   10.43.162.236   <none>        8080/TCP,8801/TCP   29s
    voting-svc   ClusterIP   10.43.51.201    <none>        8080/TCP,8801/TCP   29s
    web-app      ClusterIP   10.43.242.240   <none>        80/TCP              29s
    web-svc      ClusterIP   10.43.182.119   <none>        8080/TCP            29s
  ```

1. Since you‚Äôve already connected Telepresence to your cluster, you can access the frontend service in your browser at [http://web-app.emojivoto](http://web-app.emojivoto).  This is the namespace qualified DNS name in the form of `service.namespace`.

<Alert severity="success">
  <strong>Congratulations</strong>, you can now access services running in your cluster by name from your laptop!
</Alert>

## 4. Test app

1. Vote for some emojis and see how the [leaderboard](http://web-app.emojivoto/leaderboard) changes. 

1. There is one emoji that causes an error when you vote for it. Vote for üç© and the leaderboard does not actually update. Also an error is shown on the browser dev console:
`GET http://web-svc.emojivoto:8080/api/vote?choice=:doughnut: 500 (Internal Server Error)`

<Alert severity="info">
    Open the dev console in <strong>Chrome or Firefox</strong> with Option + ‚åò + J (macOS) or Shift + CTRL + J (Windows/Linux).<br/>
    Open the dev console in <strong>Safari</strong> with Option + ‚åò + C.
</Alert>

The error is on a backend service, so **we can add an error page to notify the user** while the bug is fixed.

## 5. Run the backend service on your laptop

Now start up the `web-app` backend service on your laptop. We'll then make a code change and intercept this service so that we can see the immediate results of a code change to the backend.

1. **In a <u>new</u> terminal window**, change into the repo directory and build the application:

  `cd <cloned repo location>/emojivoto`  
  `make web-app-local`

2. Change into the code directory and start the server:

  `cd emojivoto-web-app`  
  `yarn webpack serve`

  ```
  $ yarn webpack server
    
    ...
    ‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
    ...
    ‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdmÔΩ£: Compiled successfully.
  ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:8080 and see how voting for the üç© is generating the same error as the application deployed in the cluster.

<Alert severity="success">
    <strong>Victory</strong>, your local React server is running a-ok!
</Alert>

## 6. Make a code change
We‚Äôve now set up a local development environment for the DataProcessingService, and we‚Äôve created an intercept that sends traffic in the cluster to our local environment. We can now combine these two concepts to show how we can quickly make and test changes.

1. In your editor, open the file `emojivoto/emojivoto-web-app/js/components/Vote.jsx` and replace the render() function with the following:

  ```
  https://github.com/BuoyantIO/emojivoto/blob/fbe3ecba84ea44dff771524b664bd25af25e8b51/emojivoto-web/webapp/js/components/Vote.jsx#L83-L149
  ```

1. In a new terminal window, change to the `emojivoto-web-dir` directory and run webpack to fully recompile the code:

  `cd <cloned repo location>/emojivoto/emojivoto-web-app/`  
  `yarn webpack`

1. Reload the browser tab showing `localhost:8080` and see how the error generated by voting for the üç© is handled in a better way and improves the user experience.

## 7. Intercept all traffic to the service
Next, we‚Äôll create an intercept. An intercept is a rule that tells Telepresence where to send traffic. In this example, we will send all traffic destined for the DataProcessingService to the version of the DataProcessingService running locally instead:

1. Start the intercept with the `intercept` command, setting the workload name (a Deployment in this case), namespace, and port:  
`telepresence intercept web-app --namespace emojivoto --port 8080`

  <Alert severity="info">
    <strong>Didn't work?</strong> Make sure you are working in the terminal window where you ran the script because it sets environment variables to access the demo cluster.  Those variables will only will apply to that terminal session.
  </Alert>

  ```
  $ telepresence intercept web-app --namespace emojivoto --port 8080
    
    Using deployment web-app
    intercepted
        Intercept name: web-app
        State         : ACTIVE
    ...
  ```

2. Go to the frontend service again in your browser at [http://web-app.emojivoto](http://web-app.emojivoto). Voting for üç© should now show a message to the user that it's broke.

<Alert severity="success">
    The frontend‚Äôs request the <code>web-app</code> Deployment is being <strong>intercepted and rerouted</strong> to the Node server on your laptop!
</Alert>

<Alert severity="success">
  We‚Äôve just shown how we can edit code locally, and <strong>immediately</strong> see these changes in the cluster.
  <br />
  Normally, this process would require a container build, push to registry, and deploy.
  <br />
  With Telepresence, these changes happen instantly.
</Alert>

## 8. Create a Preview URL
Create preview URLs to do selective intercepts, meaning only traffic coming from the preview URL will be intercepted, so you can easily share the services you‚Äôre working on with your teammates.

1. Clean up your previous intercept by removing it:  
`telepresence leave web-app`

2. Login to Ambassador Cloud, a web interface for managing and sharing preview URLs:
`telepresence login`

  This opens your browser; login with your preferred identity provider and choose your org.

  ```
  $ telepresence login
    Launching browser authentication flow...
    <browser opens, login>
    Login successful.
  ```

3. Start the intercept again:  
`telepresence intercept web-app --port 8080`

   You will be asked for your ingress layer 3 address; specify the front end service: `web-app.emojivoto`
   Then when asked for the port, type `8080`, for "use TLS", type `n`.  The default for the fourth value is correct so hit enter to accept it

  ```
  $ telepresence intercept web-app --port 8080
    
    To create a preview URL, telepresence needs to know how cluster
    ingress works for this service.  Please Select the ingress to use.
    
    1/4: What's your ingress' layer 3 (IP) address?
         You may use an IP address or a DNS name (this is usually a
         "service.namespace" DNS name).
    
           [no default]: web-app.default
    
    2/4: What's your ingress' layer 4 address (TCP port number)?
    
           [no default]: 8080
    
    3/4: Does that TCP port on your ingress use TLS (as opposed to cleartext)?
    
           [default: n]: n
    
    4/4: If required by your ingress, specify a different layer 5 hostname
         (TLS-SNI, HTTP "Host" header) to access this service.
    
           [default: web-app.default]:
    
    Using deployment web-app
    intercepted
        Intercept name  : web-app
        State           : ACTIVE
        Destination     : 127.0.0.1:3000
        Intercepting    : HTTP requests that match all of:
          header("x-telepresence-intercept-id") ~= regexp("86cb4a70-c7e1-1138-89c2-d8fed7a46cae:web-app")
        Preview URL     : https://<random-subdomain>.preview.edgestack.me
        Layer 5 Hostname: web-app.default
  ```

4. Wait a moment for the intercept to start; it will also output a preview URL.  Go to this URL in your browser, it will be the <strong style="color:orange">orange</strong> version of the app.

5. Now go again to [http://verylargejavaservice:8080](http://verylargejavaservice:8080), it‚Äôs still <strong style="color:green">green</strong>.

Normal traffic coming to your app gets the <strong style="color:green">green</strong> cluster service, but traffic coming from the preview URL goes to your laptop and gets the <strong style="color:orange">orange</strong> local service!

<Alert severity="success">
  The <strong>Preview URL</strong> now shows exactly what is running on your local laptop -- in a way that can be securely shared with anyone you work with.
